# Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Simple calculation app designed without using extra packages to do the math calculations

the main purpose of this is to get a finer understanding of javascript and reactJS, although it seems simple on the surface, the goal was to make the math calculations work without needing to import extra packages

## learning better CSS

along with following the really fun and simple guide, I decided to go a little deeper into the CSS of the App itself, to give it more of a unique look as well as a better understanding of CSS within react components

## learning React

the main purpose of this project is to learn react, and front end in general, the end goal is to learn backend development, and I figured I should understand the front end to know how best to attach a custom back end to the application. chances are I will be going from javascript to something more static like GoLang or even Rust when I get better at backend and servers in general and in production
